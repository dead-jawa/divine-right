	INTRODUCTION

	DIVINE RIGHT is a fantasy game dealing with the struggles for power and territory between the various kings, queens, sorcerers, and other inhabitants of the continent of Minaria.  Players begin as monarchs of different kingdoms.  As the game proceeds, each player will attempt to build and hold together a fragile alliance of kings long enough to crush all opposition and win the game.  Assassination and back-stabbing are popular pastimes in Minaria, and loyal allies may leave the field in the middle of a campaign through the use of black magic, treachery, or skillful diplomacy.

	DIVINE RIGHT is more than just a game.  It is a work of fantasy literature, in which you, the players, control the destinies of nations.  You organize the alliances, seek out the magical treasures, and lead your armies and fleets to battles, sieges, plunder, and (if you have been wise) victory.

	The game is divided into BASIC and INTERMEDIATE sections.  An Intermediate Game option is also provided.  Master the Basic Game before trying the Intermediate rules.

SAMPLE UNITS


	The multi-colored, die cut cardboard counters are the playing pieces for DIVINE RIGHT.  They represent the leaders, armies, fleets, ambassadors, monsters, magical devices, and markers needed for play.

(Monarch-leader)

		Crown Symbol				Movement Allowance

		Coat of Arms				



Regular Army Unit:

Queen Marker
                            



Plundered Marker



Randomizer Chits:
(number indicates order
in which players will
take their turns)



	The Coat of Arms identifies each separate nation of Minaria.  It appears on each type of unit belonging to that kingdom.

	The Movement Allowance indicates the maximum number of movement points that a unit may expend in a single turn.  Each hex costs 1 or more movement points to enter, depending upon the terrain.

	Terrain Bonuses are possessed by several units in the game and by all kingdom units if inside their own kingdom.  See the Terrain Effect, in the Movement section.    



THE GAME MAP

	The game map depicts the continent of Minaria.  A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon this map to regulate movement and combat.  Each kingdom is outlined to clearly define national boundaries.  Some areas do not belong to any particular kingdom.  Each kingdom is outlined to clearly define national boundaries.  Some areas do not belong to any particular kingdom.  Mountains, hills, forest, rivers, and many other terrain features are also represented and are explained in detail on the Terrain Effects Chart.


THE CARDS

	There are three types of cards used in DIVINE RIGHT:






	((insert sample Identity card here))





	Identity cards picture a king, a queen, and names the kingdom ruled, the national coat of arms, the name of the royal castle, and the number of regular armies and fleets (if any) belonging to the kingdom.



	(Insert sample Personality card here)




	Personality cards are paired with all non player monarchs.  Each gives a brief profile of the monarch with which it has been paired and lists, in game terms, what effect the monarch's personality will have on diplomacy, movement, combat, etc.




	((insert sample Diplomacy card here))





	Diplomacy cards are  used by a player's ambassador during the Diplomacy phase.  Diplomacy cards list special maneuvers, functions, and tricks of the diplomatic art.  There are 2 basic types, the "diplomatic ploy" type and the "special mercenary" type, the latter of which is not used in the Basic Game.  




                         THE BASIC GAME

	The Basic Game is merely a stream-lined version of DIVINE RIGHT.  The Magicians, the Special Mercenaries, and the Magic Devices that are provided in the counter mix, as well as the special qualities of the Scenic hexes, are not used in Basic play.  This will simply play and allow players to master the mechanics of the game system.  All rules given in the Basic Game apply to the Intermediate Game.  Once players are conversant with the siege, movement, combat, and diplomacy rules, they will be ready to add some or all of the Intermediate Game rules, and then go on to the Advanced Game for an even more challenging simulation.  Your copy of DIVINE RIGHT provides the rules for the Intermediate Game and the Advanced Game, for those people who take their DIVINE RIGHT seriously.  These books introduce much new material and modes of variant play.  In general, the rules of the Basic Game apply to both the Intermediate and Advanced Games.



                        PREPARE FOR PLAY

	Lay the map out on a table large enough to leave room in front of each player for his Personality cards, Diplomacy cards, and other miscellaneous items essential for playing the game.  Back-folding (folding each crease in the map opposite to the way it was packaged) will allow the map to lie flat.

	Carefully separate the 45 Diplomacy cards.  Set aside the 10 special mercenary cards, which are not used in the Basic Game.  Next separate the 14 Identity cards and the 22 Personality cards.  Go through the stack of Identity cards and remove the Eaters of Wisdom and the Black Hand; these character is not used in the Basic Game.  Shuffle the Diplomacy cards and place them, face down, near the map.

	Shuffle the remaining 10 Identity cards.  Each player now draws one.  This will be the home kingdom of that player throughout the game.  Players should note the coat of arms for the kingdoms they have selected, and punch out the matching unit counters (monarch,  ambassador, armies, and fleets).  The monarchs selected represent the players themselves.  Players may opt to make their monarch a queen, by placing a "Queen marker" upon their card.  Gender has no effect upon the functioning of the monarch in play.  For purpose of clarity, the players' monarchs are referred to hereafter as "player monarchs."  If a player monarch is eliminated (killed or captured), that player is out of the game (see Re-entry of an Eliminated Player, below).  
	
	The remaining Identity cards represent "non player monarchs."  For the remainder of the game, the players will be attempting to get these monarchs and their forces to ally with them (through diplomacy) in the struggle for control of Minaria.

	Shuffle the 22 Personality cards and, without looking, place one card beneath each of the remaining Identity cards.  Any unused Personality cards are placed face down on the table near the Diplomacy cards.  The selected cards give each non player monarch a distinct personality that is only revealed later in the game when an ambassador visits the monarch in person.

	Players should also punch out and sort the unit counters for all non player kingdoms, as well as the 16 mercenary armies and 8 mercenary fleets.  These may be placed in the game box or stacked neatly near the map for future use.  The turn record indicator should be placed on the turn record track for turn 1, and one randomizer chit for each player (#1-6) in the game should be placed in an empty coffee cup or similar opaque container.

	Remove all the ambassador units which do not belong to a player king.  The unused cards and remaining unit counters are set aside at this time.  Place them within easy reach for possible later use.  

	Players now place their armies and fleets on the map according to the starting locations printed on the unit counters.  The monarch of each player kingdom always starts in the royal castle.  The ambassador may be kept off the map, upon the player monarch's Identity card.  The game is ready to begin.

	Players should take stock of all the units and castles which they possess.  Consult the map to check which castles belong to one's allotted kingdom.  The royal castle is the one with the colored background (it matches the basic color of the kingdom units).

	Read the player monarch's Identity card carefully.  It fully lists which and how many combat (and perhaps special) units which belong to the kingdom's force pool.  Most of the kingdoms have special oddities and these should be understood before the first turn.  Read the section SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING THE KINGDOMS OF MINARIA.  It helps also if the player reads the historical notes pertaining to his kingdom in the section THE KINGDOMS OF MINARIA, located toward end of this rule book.


SUGGESTED TABLE LAYOUT









	((Insert diagram  "SUGGESTED TABLE LAYOUT")






PLAYER ORDER DETERMINATION

	DIVINE RIGHT is played in successive turns called game turns.  During a game turn each of the players takes a player turn made up of rounds.

	At the start of EACH game turn, the players randomly determine who is to have the first player turn, the second, third, and so on.  The order of the players will be changing from game turn to game turn.  It is possible, therefore, for one player to be last player in one game turn and the first player in the next.

	There are 10 counters in the mix numbered 1 through 10; these are called randomizer chits.  Count out one for each player (starting with the number 1) and put them into a cup (i.e., if there are 6 players, puts chits 1-6 into a cup).  At the beginning of each game turn, all players draw one chit.  Players should keep their chits face up in front of them on the table.  The player with chit #1 has the first round, the player with chit #2 has the second, and so on.  The chits are returned to the cup prior to the start of the next game turn.



                       VICTORY CONDITIONS

	Victory in DIVINE RIGHT is determined in one of two ways.  The first and simplest way to win is to eliminate all opponents.  This rarely happens.  Victory is usually determined by a system of Victory Points.  The player who amasses the most points after 20 turns is the winner, the player with the second highest total comes in second, and so on.

	During the course of play, Victory Points are awarded as follows:

     		Deed						Victory Points

Plundering an enemy (or enemy      5 times the intrinsic defense 	allied) castle strength 
of the castle

Plundering an enemy (or enemy 	10 times the intrinsic defense
	allied) royal castle		strength of the castle

Capturing an enemy allied		30
	monarch

Killing an enemy allied			40
	monarch (except by
	assassination)

Capturing or killing an enemy 	70
	player monarch				


	All victory points should be recorded on a piece of paper as the game progresses.

	No victory points are awarded for executing prisoners.  If a monarch is captured and subsequently escapes with the aid of besiegers friendly to the monarch, or is released by the captor,  the victory points are still awarded to the captor.  If the same monarch is again captured later in the game by the same, or a different player, the victory points are again awarded.


	
PLAYER ROUND SEQUENCE OUTLINE

	Usually, only the player whose turn is in progress may perform any game functions.   When all players have finished their several player rounds, the turn record indicator is moved to record the passage of one game turn.  The game ends when one player monarch has eliminated all the other player monarchs, or 20 game turns have been played (see VICTORY CONDITIONS).


The Player Turn

	A. The first player rolls for Events    The player rolls 2 dice, 	consults the Events Table, and performs the actions indicated by the dice roll.

		The second player rolls for his Events, then the third, etc.

	B. Resolve Sieges    Any sieges being conducted by the first player are now resolved according to the rules for siege combat.

	The second player resolves his sieges, then the third, etc.

	C. Move Units and make attacks    The first player may now move as many or as few units as he wishes.  A player may move his own units, units of allied kingdoms, and/or friendly mercenaries.  Units are moved over the hexagonal grid expending one or more movement points per hex (see TERRAIN EFFECTS CHART).  Units may be moved in any direction or combination of directions, up to their full printed movement allowance.  Combat units belonging to a player may not enter the same hex as the combat units of any other player.

		When he has made all his moves, the first player states which units are being attacked, and which units will do the attacking.  All declared attacks must be carried out, unless physically impossible (e.g. certain units have deactivated and are no longer available due to other actions), in any order that he chooses.  (See COMBAT).

	The second player moves and fights combat, then the third, 
etc.


		F.  Conduct Diplomacy -- The first player conducts diplomacy.  Diplomacy consists of these steps:

	a.  Draw a Diplomacy card -- This card may be used in the current diplomacy phase, or it may be saved for use in a later game turn.

	b.  Perform one of the following actions or pass:

	i.  Attempt to Activate any non-allied kingdom.   The ambassador is placed in the royal castle of the neutral kingdom to be activated.  The Personality card of that monarch is read aloud.  If the reading of the card has not caused the player to cancel the remainder of his diplomacy phase, one die is rolled.  This die roll is called the diplomacy die Roll.  Any one Diplomacy card may be played before the die is rolled in order to modify the result.  If the number rolled (which may be modified by a Diplomacy card bonus) is a 6 or greater, the monarch, his kingdom, and its armed forces ally themselves with the player.

	ii.  Attempt to Deactivate any enemy-allied non-player monarch.  The ambassador is placed directly on the monarch of the nation to be deactivated (that is, removed from the enemy alliance).  The Personality card of that monarch is read aloud, and the diplomacy die roll is made.  Again, one Diplomacy card may be played before the die is rolled.  If the number rolled is 7 or greater, the monarch, his kingdom, and its armed forces immediately drop out of the enemy alliance and become neutral (non-allied) again.

	iii.  Attempt to assassinate any one enemy-allied non-player monarch.  See ASSASSINATION OF A NON-PLAYER MONARCH.  

	iv.  Duel an enemy ambassador.  The ambassador is placed upon the ambassador with whom the duel is to take place.  Both players roll a die.  The high roll kills the other.  Ties kill both ambassadors.

	


THE RE-ENTRY OF AN ELIMINATED PLAYER

	If a player is eliminated, he may, with the unanimous consent of all the other players, return to play as a new player king.  If he chooses to do this, all his former victory points are lost and he must randomly draw a new player king from the currently available neutral monarchs.  If the kingdom he draws has been depleted due to previous conflict, he receives their full force pool for deployment.  Plundered castles remain plundered, however.  

	If there are no neutral monarchs available, he randomly draws an non-player identity card from the player with the largest number of allies.  The new player monarch's units restored to their original starting strength.  Any units hostile to the new player monarch and deployed within his kingdom are immediately displaced from his castles and deployment hexes.  The player sets up and is ready to begin the next game turn. 

	The second player conducts diplomacy, then the third, etc.


                       RANDOM EVENTS

	Random events, both good and ill, bring additional troops to the field, storms, or even the untimely demise of an important non player ally.  Two dice are rolled by the player whose turn it is, and their total is matched with the indicated event on the Events Table.  The various possibilities are explained on the following table.  All results of a player's roll on the Events Table will occur at once.  If it is impossible to comply with the instructions as given (e.g. one does not have the unit one is required to lose), treat the result as "no event."  
 

RANDOM EVENTS TABLE


Dice Roll                  Events
	

2:  UNTIMELY DEATH    A friendly allied non player monarch (if any) dies.  Determine randomly who dies.

3:  STORMS    Lose 1 friendly fleet that is not in any port (if in possession of a fleet).  The phasing player must decide which fleet is to be eliminated.

4:  MUTINY    Lose 1 friendly regular or mercenary unit.  The phasing player must pick which unit is to be eliminated.

5:  BAD OMENS    The regulars of 1 friendly kingdom, chosen at random, will not fight or siege this game turn.  They will move and defend normally.

6:  REPLACEMENTS    Bring 2 eliminated regular units back into play in their deployment hexes (these must be units of the player monarch or his allied kingdoms).  

7:  NO EVENT

8:  REINFORCEMENTS    Bring 2 mercenary units into play in any friendly castle or (if a fleet) port hex(es).  

9:  EPIDEMIC    Eliminate half (round up) of the combat units in each friendly stack containing 10 or more.  The player chooses which combat units to eliminate.  If no stack contains 10 or more combat units, the player loses one regular or common mercenary from his largest stack. 

10:  REPLACEMENTS/REINFORCEMENTS: Bring 1 mercenary unit or previously eliminated friendly regular combat unit into play (player's choice).  Place a regular in its hex of deployment; place a mercenary in any friendly castle.

11:  DESERTION    Lose 1 mercenary unit.  The phasing player must decide which unit is to be eliminated.  

12:  HELP FROM AFAR    One non allied non player monarch becomes the phasing player's ally immediately.  Determine the identity of the new ally randomly.  Its forces cannot be moved until next turn.  If no non allied kingdoms are available, treat this result as "no event."
     
	If a player's largest stack must be reduced by Epidemic and the player has no single stack larger than any other, the player decides randomly which large stack is to be reduced.

	Replacements/Reinforcements -- As given in random events 6, 8 and 10, reinforcements are defined as new common mercenaries; replacements are restored regular units belonging to friendly kingdoms already activated.  Replacements must enter at the deployment site named on their counters.  If that hex is occupied by enemy units, or is under siege, those particular units may not enter the game.  Mercenary units must enter on a friendly castle or, if a fleet, on a friendly port hex (either castle or non-castle).  

	All replacements and reinforcements may move and fight in the same player round that they appear.  The regular forces of a kingdom may never exceed the total number given for them on the monarch's identity card.  Mercenary units, however, may supplement this total.



	Castles/Ports -- A friendly castle or port is any castle or port inside the boundaries of a kingdom belonging to the player monarch or to that monarch's allies.  Also, any plundered castle/port not meeting the above requirements is considered friendly if occupied by at least 1 friendly combat unit.  

	The term castle-port is used to denote a port which is also a castle in all respects, but it is used only when special attention needs to be drawn to the hexes capacity for functioning as a port.  All rules which pertain to castles also pertain to castle-ports; when castles are referred to, assume that castle-ports are also meant.  Non-castle ports also exist.  If the term "port" is used, it refers in a general sense to either castle- and non-castle ports.

	A player with no friendly ports may not bring in a fleet replacement or reinforcement.


MERCENARY UNITS

	Sometimes, for sake of clarity, the mercenary combat units of the Basic Game are occasionally referred to as "common" or "ordinary" mercenaries.  The counter mix provides a force pool of 16 mercenary army units, and 8 mercenary fleets.

	Mercenary units are occasionally brought into play by the Random Events Table.  When this occurs, the player adds the appropriate number of mercenary counters to his forces on the board.  They need not all be deployed in the same hex.  As long as unused fleets and land armies exist, the player has his choice as to type.  The new mercenary units may be placed on the board in any friendly castle or castles (except those that are currently besieged).  If the player has no legal hexes for immediate deployment, the mercenary unit is lost.

	If all mercenaries are already in play, the player may take the new units due to him from enemy stacks.

	If the mercenary force pool has only fleets remaining AND the player has no friendly port, the player may take the mercenary land units due him from an enemy.  

	A player may not eliminate transported enemy land units nor force a hero fate die role upon an enemy hero by taking the mercenary fleets transporting them.  However, the fleets may be taken if there are sufficient additional fleets in the stack that can accommodate the transported leaders and land units.

	The deactivation of a kingdom may result in the elimination of an common mercenary unit located inside it which is not accompanied by non-deactivating leaders and/or combat units.  See "The Diplomatic Penalty".


                           SIEGES

	No castle may be conquered by enemy combat units until after it has been besieged and a plundered result has been obtained during the attacker's siege resolution round.  Remember, unless otherwise stated, all references to "castles" also pertain to "castle-ports." 


UNITS "INSIDE" AND "OUTSIDE" A CASTLE'S WALLS

	Only one player at a time may besiege a single enemy castle.  To besiege a castle, the castle hex must be occupied by besieging units.  Units may enter the hex of an unplundered castle only if all defending units "outside" the castle (that is, in the castle hex, put outside the protection of the castle's walls) have been removed    either by retreat or by elimination.  Units inside a castle's walls do not prevent enemy entry into the hex.  Units defending from within a castle should be inverted to show their "inside the castle's walls" status.   

	There is no movement point cost for moving into or out of a castle's walls, but such a status change may only be made during the owning player's movement phase, or due to a retreat or advance during combat.


INTRINSIC DEFENSE STRENGTH

	All castles on the playing map have a number printed on the hex.  This is the intrinsic defense strength of the castle.  Enemy combat units may not enter an unplundered castle hex (whether it contains enemy combat units or not) unless they are able to declare a siege.  Heroes may enter an enemy castle, but see HERO FATE DIE ROLL.  

	To declare a siege on a castle, the attacker must occupy the castle hex with a number of combat units equal to, or greater than, the intrinsic defense strength of the castle plus any combat units inside the castle's walls.  Each combat unit is worth 1 point (remember that heroes and ambassadors are not considered combat units).  The intrinsic defense strength of a castle is only useful as a defense against sieges    it may not be used to make an attack, nor is it added to the strength of friendly units defending the hex from outside the castle.  


DECLARING A SIEGE

	The instant that the conditions for besieging a castle are met, a player may declare that a castle is "under siege."  If units defending a castle hex from outside of the castle walls retreat before combat or are eliminated (see COMBAT), the attacker has the option to advance after combat, into the castle hex (see COMBAT).  If the units do so advance, the castle is under siege.  Such an advance is possible only if the advancing stack has a remaining strength great enough to meet the normal siege conditions as given above.


EFFECTS OF A SIEGE

	Replacements and reinforcements may not enter the game in a castle under siege.  Heroes moving alone may not enter or leave a besieged castle without undergoing a hero fate die roll.  (See HERO FATE DIE ROLL.) 

	
BREAKOUTS AND SORTIES

	Combat units attempting to leave a besieged castle must first attack all besieging enemy combat units in the castle hex.  Both the attacker and defender may total their army and fleet strength together for this attack/defense.  Such combat is resolved in the same manner as normal combat, except that it takes place during the siege resolution portion of the player's turn.  Win or lose, any surviving units may then be moved out of the castle in the subsequent movement phase, up to their full movement allowance.  Besieged units that attack a besieger in the siege round may make no further attacks for the rest of the game turn.  If all the passable hexes about the castle are occupied by enemy combat units and/or impassable terrain, the besieged units may not exit the castle hex.

	Besieged forces may choose to attack during the combat portion of their turn, instead of during the siege resolution phase, but this does not allow movement afterwards.  Additional friendly forces outside the castle may join in such attacks made against the besiegers during the combat phase (see RELIEVING FORCES). 

	During an attack by defenders inside the castle's walls against besiegers, some or all heroes inside the castle may remain out of the battle.  However, a leader who does not take part in the attack may not add a combat bonus to units fighting combat with besieging enemy units.  


MIXED UNIT COMBAT AT SIEGES

	In the Basic Game, fleets and land units may fight combat together only if they jointly occupy an unplundered castle hex in a siege situation during the siege phase, but may not attack one another in the combat phase.  That is, all combat units stacked in a castle hex are treated as undistinguished strength points during the siege phase.  
  

RESOLVING A SIEGE

	Once a siege has been declared, and as long as it is in effect, a siege die roll must be made in each of the besieging player's subsequent siege phases.

	Prior to resolving any siege attacks, the besieging player points out all the castles which shall be attacked before any attack is made.  If the player has any units or heroes stacked with besiegers at that point, but which he does not want to be part of the attack must be immediately displaced from the hex before the siege die roll is made.  (CAUTION: he must not remove so many that a 1 to 1 ratio of strength ceases to be maintained.)  

	These units (which have been displaced from a besieging stack) are then regarded as unused units and are able to be moved in the friendly movement phase of the same turn.  NOTE:  Combat units that actually take part in a siege attack may not be moved in the movement phase of that turn.

	To make a siege attack, 1 die is rolled.  This is called the siege die roll.  If the result is "6," the castle is taken and "plunder" is automatic.  (This represents taking a castle by its craven surrender, or by a clever stratagem, or through treachery from within the enemy garrison.)  All combat units within the plundered castle are eliminated.  All heroes in the castle must take a hero fate die roll.  A Plundered marker is placed on the castle and the winning player scores victory points (see VICTORY CONDITIONS).  Units that have made a siege attack (successful or not) may not otherwise move or attack in the same game turn.

	If the siege die roll is 2 5, nothing happens.  The siege may continue as long as the besieging forces are able to maintain the conditions of siege.  

	If the result is "1" (ignoring modifications), the attack has failed and 1 besieging combat unit is eliminated.  Further, besieging heroes must take hero fate die rolls (see THE HERO FATE DIE ROLL).  Captured heroes are placed inside the castle's walls with the defenders (or intrinsic defense).  However, if the same siege attack causes the castle to be plundered, any "captured" result against a besieging hero is ignored.

	A plundered castle ungarrisoned by the enemy is treated as though it were nonexistent for purposes of siege or combat.  It does, however, retain its function as a placement hex for regulars or mercenaries.  If it was a royal castle, it may continue as the location for the conduct of diplomacy, provided it is not enemy occupied.  

	Occupying a plundered castle with a combat unit makes the castle friendly for purposes of entering mercenaries. Once a castle is plundered, it remains plundered for the rest of the game, and its intrinsic defense strength is lost.
 
	Modifying the Siege Die Roll    The greater the attacking force, the better the attacker's chance of success.  Divide the total number of attacking combat units inside the castle hex by the total strength of all defending units plus the intrinsic defense strength of the castle.  Drop any fractions and subtract one.  The number remaining is added to the attacker's siege roll.  NOTE:  Remember, a natural roll of "1" is a failed attack.  


EXAMPLE #1:  15 combat units besiege a castle with an intrinsic defense strength of 4.  The castle has 3 combat units inside, giving it a total strength of 7.  (15/7 = 2.14).  Dropping the fraction and subtracting 1 (2   1), leaves 1.  Therefore, 1 is added to the attacker's siege die roll.  Hence, a roll of 5 or 6 on the die would plunder the castle.


EXAMPLE #2:  This time, the castle with an intrinsic defense of 4 has 4 combat units inside, giving it a total strength of 8, while the besieger again attacks with 15.  (15/8 = 1.88).  Dropping the fraction and subtracting 1 leaves zero.  That is, there shall be no addition to the die roll.


EXAMPLE #3:  If only 1 combat unit were inside the castle (with an intrinsic defense strength of 4) defending against 15, 2 would be added to the attacker's siege die roll (15/5 = 3; 3   1 = 2).


FLEETS AT SIEGES

	Fleets may contribute their strength to both the defense and attack in Siege phase combat involving a castle-port.  

	Land combat units aboard fleets that reinforce a siege are debarked in the siege hex and are thereafter considered part of the land based besieging force.

	Fleets may freely enter and exit friendly besieged castle-ports and may transport combat units into and out of a besieged castle-port, unless the besieger has at least 1 fleet combat unit in his stack. 

	The freedom of fleets at sieges is a factor of movement only.  A fleet may not come as a replacement nor a reinforcement into a besieged castle-port, even if the castle-port is besieged by land units only.


RELIEVING FORCES

	Friendly forces outside a besieged castle may win the right to advance into the castle hex and into the castle walls by moving adjacent to it and attacking the besieging units in the combat phase.  If both the besiegers and relief force have land units and fleets, the relieving player my fight one or two combats (land and sea) separately.  Any such attack is made during the besieged player's combat phase and may be done alone or in conjunction with the appropriate friendly besieged units.  Win or lose, the relieving force may then advance into the castle to join the besieged force.  


	Besieger Displacement    Should losses or the entry of a relieving into a castle reduce the proportion of besiegers to besieged to less than 1 to 1, the besieger must displace his forces from the hex at the end of the current game turn.  Despite the reduction of forces, until the displacement occurs, the siege condition persists, except that the siege resolution die may not be rolled.

	Sometimes enemy units in one or more adjacent non castle hexes will bar the displacement described above.  In such cases, the friendly displacing stack displaces the enemy units (but only if the enemy units have an unobstructed route of displacement).  Each player determines the route of his own units' displacement, but the friendly stack must eliminate a number of friendly combat units equal to the number of enemy combat units that it displaces.  

	If the enemy units barring the friendly stack's displacement are equal or greater in number, or if they have no unobstructed route of displacement, they are not displaced and all the friendly combat units are eliminated.  Any friendly heroes located in a totally eliminated stack must take a hero fate die roll.  

	A land combat unit may displace into a sea or lake hex only if an empty friendly fleet is available to carry it

	If all adjacent hexes are impassable terrain (e.g. as around Thores), the friendly units unable to displace are eliminated and any heroes with them must take a hero fate die roll.

	Mixed-Unit Combat During Relief -- Because relief combat is fought in the Combat phase, Army and fleet units may not attack one another in the course of relief combat.  Relieving forces attacking during the combat phase do not treat the elements of a besieging stacks as a unity.  Relieving land forces must attack besieging land units, while relieving may fleets may only attack besieging fleet units.

	EXAMPLE:  A friendly castle-port is besieged by 2 enemy fleets and 6 land combat units.  A relieving force consisting of 4 fleets and 2 transported land units attack.  The attacker chooses to fight with only his 4 fleets vs the 2 enemy fleets (in this case both his land units on the fleets and the enemy land unit are discounted.  The combat is fought at odds of 2 to 1.  After the attack, the 2 besieging fleets survive, as do 3 of the relieving fleets, and these 3 fleets now enter the besieged castle-port (along with the 2 transported land units).  Although the 2 arriving land units have technically not fought as yet, they may not initiate any further attacks this game turn because the time for announcing any new attacks is over.

	It is possible that instead of launching an ordinary combat as given above, the player may opt for the riskier (but often useful) attack by means of Amphibious Attack (see below).

	Amphibious Attacks	-- The player may attack a body of enemy combat units in a port hex (either castle-or non-castle) but which are "outside" the port.  Besiegers of a friendly castle-port may be attacked by means of "amphibious landing."  But such landings are dangerous and should not be engaged in lightly.
  
	Enemy land units located "outside" a port may be attacked from adjacent sea hexes by friendly fleet units alone or in combination with any land units which they may be transporting.  (This is an exception to the restriction on combat by transported land units, but is necessary to assault particularly the one-hex island ports.  However, any enemy fleets in the hex (either inside or outside the castle-port) may be added to the defender's strength.  Should the amphibious force lose the battle (i.e. take greater or equal losses), half the surviving amphibious attackers, land units and fleets are eliminated.  He may take losses from either land units or fleets, or a combination of both.  The survivors either remains at sea in place, or (if the port is a friendly besieged castle) may advance into the castle as a relieving force.

EXAMPLE:  4 besieging Mivioran land units are in the hex of the Rombuni port of Thores are "outside" it.  The Rombuni fleet stops adjacent to the castle with four fleets and 4 land units.  The Rombunis may attack the Mivioran units at 2 to 1 (8 vs 4) by means of amphibious landing.


BESIEGING NEUTRAL CASTLES

	If a player declares a siege against a neutral non player castle, the kingdom in which the castle is located immediately becomes the ally of a randomly determined enemy player.  Deploy the kingdom's units immediately.  This will usually mean that some units will be deployed in the very castle that is under siege.  If the besieger has maintained a ratio of at least 1:1 in respect of the strength of the castle and its increased garrison, the siege continues.  If, however, the resultant change in the strength of the castle vs the besieger's strength to fall below 1:1, the siege condition becomes invalid.  Should this happen, the besieging units are displaced from the castle hex at the end of the current game turn. 


NON SIEGE ATTACKS BY BESIEGERS

	A unit occupying a stack of friendly besiegers may attack adjacent enemy units outside the castle hex while still being considered part of the besieging stack.  But if it has already participated in a siege attack that player turn, it may not attack again in the combat phase.



                          MOVEMENT

	During the movement phase of a given player turn, the player may move any, all, or none of his units, in any direction or combination of directions.  Only the player whose turn it is may move units.

	Units, or stacks of units, are moved, one at a time, tracing a path of contiguous hexes over the playing map.  As each unit, or stack, enters a hex, it expends one or more movement points from its movement allowance, depending upon the type of terrain in the hex.


THE MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE

	The movement allowance of a given unit is printed on the upper right corner of that unit.  The movement allowance of a unit is the number of movement points it may expend in a single game turn.  Movement points may not be "saved" from one turn to the next, nor may they be transferred from one unit to another.


HOW TO MOVE

	Movement is calculated in terms of movement points.  A clear terrain hex costs one movement point to enter, other types may cost more.  A unit expends the movement point cost listed on the Terrain Effects Chart to enter each hex of a particular type of terrain (see Terrain Effects Chart).

	Units which are not led by leader units (see LEADERS) do not move as stacks, but individually and need not stay together throughout a move.  For simplicity's sake, a player may move an entire stack at once, but he must remember that this really represents collective individual movement and some units have more or fewer movement points than others.

	Combat units belonging to a player may not enter hexes occupied by combat units of the same type belonging to another player.  Combat units belonging to a player may not stop in a hex occupied by combat units belonging to another player, regardless of type, except to lay siege (also, see STACKING).  An (unplundered) enemy castle hex may not be passed through by non flying units, even if the enemy is entirely "inside" the castle's walls and has no units of the same type as those in the friendly stack.


MOVEMENT AND TERRAIN
	
	Each different type of terrain is assigned a standard movement point cost.  As a unit enters a hex, the appropriate number of movement points are expended from its movement point allowance.  No unit may enter a hex unless it has sufficient movement allowance to pay all movement expenses for the hex.  However, a unit may always move at least a single hex, even if it does not otherwise possess sufficient movement points to do so.


THE TERRAIN CHART

Clear; 1 movement point per hex. 


Forest; 2 movement points per hex.  This type of terrain is more easily entered or traversed by units with special terrain bonuses (see SPECIAL TERRAIN BONUSES).  NOTE: that there are two different map symbols for forests; this is simply for aesthetic reasons


Hills; 2 movement points per hex.  This type of terrain is more easily entered or traversed by units with special terrain bonuses (see SPECIAL TERRAIN BONUSES).


Mountain; 3 movement points per hex.  A unit entering a mountain hex must cease movement.  Units defending in a mountain hex may add 1 to the combat die roll.  This type of terrain is more easily entered or traversed by units with special terrain bonuses (see SPECIAL TERRAIN BONUSES).

Mountain-Forest; 4 movement points per hex; otherwise treat as a mountain.  (see MOVEMENT IN COMBINED TERRAIN)

Swamp; 2 movement points per hex.  Fleet units may not enter.  This type of terrain is more easily entered or traversed by units with special terrain bonuses (see SPECIAL TERRAIN BONUSES.


Lake Shore; Land units pay the cost of any other terrain in the hex and may not cross all water hexsides.



Isle of Fright; one movement point for fleets to enter.  Land units may not land.  Fleet may only enter if effecting a rescue.


Coast; 1 movement point for fleets; land units pay the cost of any other land terrain in the hex and may not cross all water hexsides. 

Open Sea; 1 movement point for fleets. 


River; +1 movement point to enter or leave a river hex.  Movement along a river to enter another hex of the same river isn't modified.  (See RIVERS, below).   


Navigable River; see RIVERS, below.


Mountain pass; 2 movement points to enter.  Units defending in a mountain pass hex are doubled in combat value.


Castle; forbidden to enemy units (but see SIEGES).  Units pay 1 movement point to enter.  Castles with colored backgrounds are royal castles.

Castle-Port; same as castle hex.  Fleets and land units enter at the cost of 1 movement point.



Ancient Battlefield; clear terrain.  They are simply decoration in the Basic Game.



Scenic Hex; See below.



SCENIC HEX TERRAIN

	Treat scenic hexes (including Death Wind Abyss) as clear terrain, except for the following:

	Open sea:  Serpent Bay, Boarhort's Boom, and Burial Reef

	Coast: Faces to the Sea

	Forest:  Wolves' Den, Gorpin Woodsmen, the Havens, and 		Camptown

	Castle:  Stubstaff Keep 

	Hill:  the Crater, the Mounds, and all 4 Trollish kingdom 		hexes

	Lake Shore:  Mystic Lake

	Mountain:  Winter Rest, Temple of Kings, and Ozerg Mountain 

	River:  Falls of Xag

	Non-castle Ports:  Freeport and Bartertown

	Swamp:  Willowik and the Ruins of Letho


	Some scenic hexes have a red dot.  These dots have no meaning in the Basic Game.  


NON-CASTLE PORTS

	Non-Castle ports are small affairs.  Each may shelter a single fleet from a Storm random event.  Fleets and land units enter at the cost of 1 movement point.  Additional fleets in the port hex are not protected.  Land combat units may freely enter the port unless the hex is occupied enemy land units.  

	If occupied by friendly combat units, a non-castle function as friendly ports.  For control purpose, land combat units are superior to fleet units, friendly land units may enter the port if it is occupied solely by an enemy fleet unit (as if it were a coastal hex, see STACKING), and thereby seize control of the port hex.  The enemy fleet is displaced from the hex at the end of movement.
	
 
RIVERS

	Rivers that do not cross at least 2 sides of a hex are merely decorative and have no effect upon movement.  

	A river adds +1 to the movement point cost of the hex it is located in only if a land unit is entering or exiting the river valley.  If a unit moves into an adjacent river hex (that is, moves along the river bank), it pays only the non river terrain costs. 

	Land units may not fight land combat across a navigable hexside.  Neither may a land unit cross a navigable river hexside unless it begins its movement phase adjacent to the hexside to be crossed (having taken time to prepare a ferrying operation).  The navigable river hexside has a movement point cost of 2 when crossed.  Fleets move along navigable rivers (they are understood to be on the hexside regardless of which side of the river their counter is stacked).  Enemy land units can be moved through but cannot be stopped upon during their progress along the hexside.  Fleets moving upstream along a navigable river pay 2 movement points per hex.  Moving downstream,fleets pay 1 movement point per hex.  Moving the counter from one side of the river or the other, while remaining on the same hexside, does not cost movement points.


SPECIAL TERRAIN BONUSES

	There are 3 ways that a unit may gain a special terrain bonus:  a) it is printed on the counter; b) it is a unit led by a leader with such a symbol; c) it is a unit in the kingdom of its origin (e.g. a Ponese unit in Pon); 4) it is a unit led by a leader who is traveling through the terrain hexes of his home kingdom (see THE LEADER MOVEMENT BONUS, below).

	In the Basic Game, some units have forest symbol, a swamp symbol, a mountain symbol, or more than one such symbol printed beneath their movement allowance.  

[INSERT SYMBOL]:  Units with the forest symbol treat forests (both types) as clear terrain.

[INSERT SYMBOL]:  Units with the mountain symbol treat hills and mountain passes as clear terrain and need not stop upon entering a mountain hex (although they must still pay 3 movement points per mountain hex entered).  

[INSERT SYMBOL]:  Units with the water plant symbol treat swamp hexes as clear terrain.  

	Leader units may pass their movement bonuses on to land units which they lead (See THE LEADER MOVEMENT BONUS), but combat units cannot transfer the bonus.

	d.  All regulars possess forest, swamp, and mountain terrain bonuses within their home kingdom.  In the basic game, no counter has a printed forest terrain advantage symbol, but units in their own home kingdom possess this bonus nonetheless and treat forest hexes as clear terrain.  


AMBASSADOR MOVEMENT

	Ambassadors do not have a movement allowance.  They are simply placed on the hex where a diplomatic function is to occur.  Afterwards, they are returned to their monarch's Identity card, off the map.  Such moves are made without regard to distance or intervening terrain.


MOVEMENT AND DIPLOMACY

	Moving into neutral kingdoms has diplomatic repercussions.  See DIPLOMACY; OTHER DIPLOMACY RULES, The Diplomatic Penalty.


MOVEMENT IN COMBINED TERRAIN

	The presence of a river may increase the movement point cost of a hex.  Depending upon the direction of movement, a river in a mountain forest hex might make the movement cost into a hex as much as 5.

	A unit's terrain bonus may negate all or part of the penalties for combined terrain.  For example, a Neuth mountain forest hex would cost a Neuth unit (which has a forest terrain bonus) only 3 movement points (effectively treating the hex as merely mountain terrain).


MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS

	No unit may expend a number of movement points greater than its printed movement allowance (but units may receive a movement bonus when stacked with leaders).  Land units may not cross all sea hexsides.  Fleets may not cross all land hexsides.

	All ports are considered to be coastal hexes and may be entered by both fleets and land units.

	No unit may move or retreat off the playing map.  A unit which does so for any reason other than the rules given in OFF THE MAP TRAVEL (below) is eliminated.


FLEET MOVEMENT

	Fleets are sea going combat units.  They may enter all sea hexes, coastal hexes, and friendly ports, expending 1 movement point per hex.  Fleet may siege enemy castle-ports, either by themselves or in conjunction with friendly land units.  Fleets may not enter a hex containing enemy fleet units (except after a relieving attack upon a besieging force).  Fleets never force a hero fate die roll upon lone enemy monarchs in a coastal hexes.   

SEA TRANSPORT

	Fleets may transport land combat units, devices, and heroes by sea.  Each fleet may carry 1 combat unit and any number of heroes.  To do so, the fleet moves into the hex of the unit to be transported, and embarks the unit.  The fleet may then continue movement.  A unit being transported by a fleet may not embark or debark in any coastal hex that contains mountains.  It may embark/debark to/from a friendly non port castle, but not from an enemy one.  Embarking and debarking are accomplished at no cost in movement points to the fleet.  A fleet may continue moving, embarking, and debarking land units until its movement allowance is spent.  Units being transported by sea may not otherwise move in that turn.


LEADER-ASSISTED MOVEMENT

	Leaders have the ability to improve the movement capabilities of the units which they lead.  See THE LEADER MOVEMENT BONUS.


ZONES OF CONTROL

	Unlike many other games, units in DIVINE RIGHT do not have zones of control.  This is due to the small size of the armies, relative to the large area enclosed by a hex.  Each unit controls only the hex that it occupies.  Units may pass through hexes adjacent to enemy units without penalty or delay.  



                            STACKING

	All friendly combat units and heroes may stack together in the Basic Game.  Friendly allied units from non player kingdoms may stack with those of other friendly kingdoms and may enter and defend any friendly castle.  Any player, at any time, may examine the stacks of opposing players to determine their contents.

	Fleets may enter coastal hexes with enemy lang units, but may not stop there.  Land units may stop in coastal hexes occupied by enemy fleets, but the fleet unit is subsequently displaced at the end of the current movement phase.


ARMY MARKERS

	Due to the difficulty of handling large stacks, the players may wish to use Army markers to represent large stacks on the map.  Five marker counters are provided for each of 6 possible players.  An Army marker on the board corresponds to units stacked in the corresponding box on the player's Army Display Sheet.  Any units that enter or exit the hex containing the Army marker may subsequently be added to or subtracted from the off map stack on the display.  Any units in the off map display box may be placed into the hex of the Army counter.  There is no movement point cost for this. 

	Because some units move at different rates, it may be prudent to keep any slower moving units on the map and the other, faster, units on the display, lest they inadvertently be moved at the same rate.



                             COMBAT

	Combat occurs between adjacent opposing units at the discretion of the player whose movement/combat turn is in progress.  This player is considered the attacker.  Players owning units that are being attacked are the defenders, regardless of the overall strategic situation.  

	To resolve an attack, the attacker and the defender each roll a die.  This is called the combat die roll.  The combat die roll of both the attacker and defender can be modified by having superior numbers, or monarchs with special Personality cards that assist (or hinder) combat.  The high (modified) roll is the winner, the low roll is the loser.  The loser must remove a number of combat units equal to the difference between the combat die rolls.  

	When taking combat losses, the owning player always decides which of his units shall be eliminated.  Seaborne land units aboard eliminated fleets are also eliminated, but do not count against losses to be removed.

	All attacks must be stated before any are resolved, but attacks may be resolved in any order that the attacker chooses.  The results of each attack are applied immediately after the attack is executed.

	If all defending units in a given hex are eliminated, the attacker may advance after combat some, all, or none of the units that conducted the attack into the hex vacated by the defender.  Should an attacker be totally eliminated, surviving defending units may not advance into the vacated hex.

	
MODIFYING THE COMBAT DIE

	The combat strength of all combat units in the DIVINE RIGHT Basic Game is "1."  The combat die roll may be modified as follows:  

	The combat strength of all units making the attack is totalled.  The combat strength of all defending units in the hex under attack is computed likewise.  The larger total is divided by the smaller total.  If the attacking force is larger, round the result down, in favor of the defender, to get a simple ratio, such as "4" to "1".  Now simply add each player's ratio number (e.g., 4 or 1) to his respective die roll result.  In the above example, one would add 4 to the die roll of the larger force, and 1 to the die roll of the smaller force.  

EXAMPLE 1:  5 units attack 3.  Dividing, 5/3 = 1.66.  Rounding in favor the defender yields "1."   The ratio is 1 to 1.  Add "1" to each of the two player's die results.  (NOTE:  In the 1 to 1 situation, it proper to ignore the modification and accept the straight die roll.)

EXAMPLE 2:  7 units attack 3.  Dividing, 7/3 = 2.33.  Rounding in favor of the defender yields "2 to 1."  Add "2" to the attacker's die roll result, and add "1" to the defender's.  (For those who can do quick arithmetical calculations, this is exactly the same as calculating the ratio as given, then subtracting "1" from each players' result before applying it). 

	If the defender's force is larger, round the ratio up, in favor of the defender.

EXAMPLE 3:  3 units attack 4.  Dividing the larger by the smaller number, 4/3 = 1.25.  Rounding up in favor of the defender yields "1 to 2."  Add "2" to the defender's die result, and "1" to the attacker's).

EXAMPLE 4:  1 unit attacks 3.  Dividing the larger by the smaller, 3/1 = 3.  This is a 1 to 3 attack in favor of the defender.  Add "1" to the attacker's combat die result, and add "3" to the defender's.


TIES

	If modified combat die result is a tie, both the attacker and defender must lose a number of combat units equal to the ACTUAL NUMBER shown upon the die rolled by the player with fewer forces engaged.  However, the player with more units in the combat is never required to eliminate more than twice the actual losses of the smaller force.  

EXAMPLE 1:  A stack of 8 combat units attacks a stack of 4.  It is a 2 to 1 attack.  Each player rolls a combat die; the attacker rolls a 2 (which is modified -- for odds -- by +2) and the defender rolls a 3 (which is modified for odds by +1).  The result is a tie (because each player has a result that modifies to a "4.")  Because the player with the fewer forces has rolled (an unmodified) 3, each player would lose 3 units.  

EXAMPLE 2:  A stack of 6 combat units attacks a single enemy unit.  It is an 6 to 1 attack.  The attacker rolls a 1, and the defender rolls a 6.  These results when modified (by +6 and +1 respectively) to yield a tie of "7."  The defender has only 1 unit to lose.  The attacker need not lose 7 units, however, because of the small size of the defender's casualties.  He loses a sum equal to the other player's actual losses x2.  In this case 1 x 2 means that the attacker loses 2 units. 


WHICH UNITS MAY ATTACK

	Only those units belonging to the player who is taking his movement/combat turn may attack.  Units that have declared a siege, or have made a siege attack in the game turn may not attack during the friendly movement/combat round.  Land combat units that are aboard fleets may not participate in combat, unless a port is being attacked (see Amphibious Attacks).  Replacements and reinforcements entered during the random events round may attack in the same game turn.

	Units may attack any or all enemy units adjacent to them, except those "inside" castles, or those which occupy a type of terrain which the unit cannot enter (e.g. a land unit vs a unit in a sea hex.  Only those units directly adjacent to a given enemy unit or stack may participate in an attack upon that unit or stack.

	All units in an attacking stack must attack.  Units need not attack all adjacent stacks, however, and, indeed, are not compelled to attack at all.  Once a unit has participated in an attack upon an enemy combat unit, it may not make any other attack for the duration of that movement/combat phase.

	No combat unit may be attacked twice in the same player’s movement/combat phase.




	(INSERT DIAGRAM)



EXAMPLE:  A, B and C are friendly stacks.  X, Y, and Z are enemy stacks.  A and B may both attack X, or A may attack X alone.  B may attack X alone, Y alone, or both X and Y together.  C may only attack Z.


MIXED TYPE COMBAT

	In the Basic Game, fleets and land units may fight combat together only in a siege situation during the siege phase, but may not attack one another in the combat phase.  The presence of one type of unit is ignored by the other even if they should occupy the same hex.   


THE EFFECTS OF TERRAIN 

	Only mountain hexes and mountain pass hexes have any effect upon combat.  Units defending in a mountain may add +1 to their combat die roll.  Units defending in a mountain pass have their combat strengths doubled.  These terrain bonuses are in addition to any other combat bonuses (e.g. those that come from leaders and other sources), but are for defensive combat only.

	Land units may not attack across an all sea or navigable river hex side, nor may fleets attack across an all land hexside.


RETREAT BEFORE COMBAT

	After an attack has been declared, but before combat dice are rolled, the defender may attempt to retreat before combat to avoid taking losses.  The ability to retreat before combat is determined by a die roll, and the chance of success is dictated by the type of combat unit trying to retreat:


Type of Unit:						Retreats on a roll of:

Human (most kingdoms)			     4, 5, or 6

Non Human (Neuth, Ghem, Nithmere,)		3, 4, 5, or 6

	When a stack is attempting to retreat, test the type of unit with the least chance of success first; if it succeeds, all other units in the stack may retreat without further die rolls.  

EXAMPLE 1: Mercenaries (always treated as humans) stacked with Elves from Neuth (nonhumans) receive a roll of 5.  Both they and the Elves may retreat before combat.  If the player had rolled a 2, they would be would be forced to stand and fight.  The Elves could still roll to retreat without the mercenaries, if their owner so desires.

EXAMPLE 2: A mixed stack of Elves and Dwarves attempt retreat from an enemy attack.  A retreat roll of “2" is rolled.  Neither the Elves nor the Dwarves may retreat from the combat situation.

	Any units successfully retreating before combat may move to an adjacent hex.  All units in a given hex of the same type (land or fleet unit) that retreat on a single die roll must retreat to the same hex.  They may not retreat into the hex of an enemy combat unit or an unplundered enemy castle (unless it is besieged by friendly combat units), nor into any hex occupied by friendly combat units that are under a yet-to-be resolved attack that player round.  If no legal hex is available for a stack to retreat into, no retreat takes place, regardless of the die roll.

	If, after a retreat before combat, a unit or stack is still adjacent to any of the units that were attempting to attack it, or other or other of the same enemy player's units which are capable of attacking it (i.e. have not already attacked that player round, or are not involved in an unresolved-but-already-declared battle), the retreated unit or stack may still be attacked.  No second retreat before combat is allowed.
			
	A retreat may be aborted, even if the retreat roll is made and is successful.  For example, if Elves and Dwarves are stacked with human units and are able to retreat, while the humans are unable to, the player may opt to keep the Elves and humans together to face the attack at better odds, while letting the Dwarves retreat (to, say, keep a valuable Dwarven king from danger).


ADVANCE AFTER COMBAT

	Attacking units may advance into a hex that is vacated by defenders which have evaded their attack by retreat, but such advancing units may make no further attacks in that turn.  

	Hero units do not retreat unless friendly combat units do so also.  Heroes simply ride a combat unit away during its retreat.



                            DIPLOMACY

	In DIVINE RIGHT, good diplomacy, more than any other aspect of play, will prove the key to success.  At this time it should be pointed out that diplomacy is defined as taking place between the ambassador belonging to the player monarch and non player monarchs.  All player monarchs are considered to be enemies, even if two or more are cooperating for a common cause.  Alliances, when they occur, are defined as existing between a player monarch and any number of non player monarchs.  Temporary agreements between players are not alliances and have no enforcement rules.

	Each player monarch has one ambassador, which is kept off the board during enemy turns.  An ambassador represents not merely an individual, but the entire diplomatic apparatus of the player monarch.  Consequently, the ambassador is not classified as a "hero" and so is not subject to the rules which pertains to heroes.  The best place to deploy an ambassador when not in active use is upon one's Identity card.  

	NOTE:  Only the ambassadors of player monarchs are used; set aside all ambassadors belonging to non-player kingdoms.  

	On any given player's diplomacy round, a player monarch's ambassador may work at any one of the 4 different diplomatic tasks of the Basic Game.

	1.  	Attempt to Activate any non allied non player monarch.
	2.  	Attempt to Deactivate any one enemy allied 		non player monarch.
	3.  	Attempt to Assassinate any one enemy allied 		non player monarch. 
	4.   Duel an enemy Ambassador.
	
	Ambassadors represent many individuals serving in distant capitals.  But the death of an Ambassador signifies a diplomatic catastrophe that throws the whole service into temporary disarray.  Two game turns must pass before diplomatic activity may resume.  Ambassadors do not need a movement allowance    the unit is simply placed in the hex where the diplomatic function is to occur.  The movement of ambassadors is in no way hindered by sieges or other activities of combat units.  Ambassadors are not heroes and never need to make hero fate die rolls.

	After a diplomatic task is resolved, be it a success or failure, the ambassador is returned to its monarch's Identity card (unless, of course, the ambassador is dead).

	The Diplomacy cards list the maneuvers and tricks of the diplomatic art in Minaria.  These are called diplomatic ploys and they grant bonuses to the diplomatic die roll.

	Before conducting diplomacy, a player draws 1 Diplomacy card, even if that player's ambassador is at present dead.  Diplomacy cards may be accumulated, but may not be traded, or transferred between the players.

	Inventory of the Cards (45)
	
	4    Long orations +1			2    Long Orations +2
	4    Bribes +1					2    Bribes +2
	3    Crass Bribes +2			2    Threats +1

	1    Black Magic +3				10    Special Mercenary 

	No more than 4 Diplomacy cards may be retained by a single player at the end of a diplomacy phase.  The player must discard any excess cards at the end of his diplomacy round.  In the Basic Game, no more than 1 Diplomacy card may be played per friendly diplomacy phase.

	When all Diplomacy cards have been drawn, the discard pile is reshuffled and the deck is turned face down for reuse.
 

ACTIVATING A NON PLAYER KINGDOM

	To activate a non allied, non player kingdom, the ambassador is placed in the royal castle of any non allied non player monarch.  The Personality card of that monarch is read out loud.  The Personality cards often give bonuses or penalties to various diplomatic ploys.  These are in addition to the modification given by the Diplomacy cards.  

	Having read the Personality card, the player next decides which Diplomacy card (if any) his ambassador will use, and finally rolls 1 die.  This is called the diplomacy die roll.  If the result, after all bonuses have been added and penalties subtracted, is a 6 or more, the non player monarch has joined the player monarch as an ally (this is called activation).  If a Diplomacy card has been used, it is now discarded. 

	The new ally's forces and monarch unit, are set up on the playing map immediately, according to the deployment locations specified on the unit counters, and may move and attack in the next friendly movement phase.  

	
DEACTIVATING A NON PLAYER KINGDOM

	Enemy allied non player monarchs (but not friendly-allied monarchs) may be persuaded to drop out of the alliance (deactivate) in a manner similar to activation.  To deactivate a non player kingdom, the player announces his intention and indicates which monarch is the target of his deactivation diplomacy (by putting the monarch piece on the target monarch unit, his royal castle, or simply just pointing, whatever the group prefers).  The player with the ambassador may play 1 Diplomacy card.  Finally a die is rolled.  If the modified result is a 7 or more, the monarch is deactivated and drops out of the enemy alliance.  If a Diplomacy card was played, it is now discarded.

	Deactivated forces are gathered up and may either be kept off the map until needed again, or inverted and placed in their deployment hexes.  The Identity card and the Personality card of the deactivated monarch remain together, and are returned to the pool of non allied non player monarchs.  Any regular units eliminated while their monarch was active remain eliminated.  Regulars may be replaced (via events) only while a kingdom is active.  Only those regulars which were alive at the time of deactivation are available later, should the kingdom be activated for a second time.  

	If a common mercenary unit occupies the deactivating kingdom and it is not stacked with a non-deactiving leader or combat unit, it is eliminated and returned to the mercenary force pool.

	A non player kingdom may be activated and deactivated any number of times.  IMPORTANT:  A non player monarch whose kingdom has a castle under siege may not be deactivated.    


ASSASSINATION OF A NON PLAYER MONARCH

	Once, during the entire game, each player monarch may send his ambassador in an attempt to assassinate an enemy allied non player monarch.  The ambassador is placed on the intended victim.  Diplomacy cards may not be played.  Both players roll a die.  If the monarch rolls higher, the ambassador is dead.  If the ambassador rolls higher, the monarch is dead.  If the result is a tie, nobody is killed.

	An assassination that is successful deactivates the monarch and his forces (see "Death of a Non Player Monarch").  However, no victory points are scored. 

	After any unsuccessful assassination attempt, the ambassador (or his successors, if killed) is banished from the kingdom until the offended monarch dies at a later time. 


DUELING AN ENEMY AMBASSADOR

	A player may have his ambassador duel, once per game, with each of the other players' ambassadors.  Regardless of who makes the challenge, each ambassador may duel each other ambassador only once.  The ambassador counter is placed with the intended opponent.  No Diplomacy cards may be played.  Both players roll a die.  The lower roll loses, and that ambassador is killed.  If the result is a tie, both ambassadors are killed.  An ambassador may not refuse a challenge.


OTHER DIPLOMACY RULES

	The Death of an Ambassador    Occasionally, an ambassador is killed.  When this happens, the ambassador unit is temporarily removed from the map for the next 2 complete game turns.  A dead Ambassador should be placed on the Turn Record Track, 3 spaces ahead, to represent his two turns of inactivity.  On the third game turn after the ambassador's death, the player's ambassador unit is returned to the playing map.  (E.g. an Ambassador killed in turn 5 may work diplomacy again in turn 8).  Any Diplomatic penalties incurred by one ambassador is passed on to all successors.

	Banishing Ambassadors    The play of certain Diplomacy cards    Black Magic, Threats, Blackmail, and Crass Bribes    cause the banishment of the ambassador if the diplomacy die roll fails. While banished, the ambassador may not attempt any of the diplomatic functions upon the offended monarch or kingdom.  The term of banishment is a number of turns equal to the modifying number on the Diplomacy card, plus 1.  Thus, if a player is unsuccessful with a +1 Threat, the ambassador would be banished from that kingdom for 2 full game turns.  A side record of banishments should be kept with paper and pencil.

	Certain Personality cards may also require the banishment of an ambassador. If a player manages to incur both types of banishment at once, the terms of banishment are added together.


	The Diplomatic Penalty    When units of any type (except ambassadors) cross a border and enter the territory of a non allied kingdom, the violating player is subject to the Diplomatic Penalty.  Any subsequent diplomacy die rolls attempted with the violated kingdom are made with 1 subtracted from the die roll.  The Diplomatic Penalty is never imposed for entering activated kingdoms.  Once a non allied kingdom has been violated, any subsequent violations of its territory by the same player do not result in further penalty.

	Units (including those common mercenaries that are not eliminated consequent to the deactivation) within a kingdom that has suddenly deactivated have their next friendly movement phase to leave the now neutral kingdom or else incur the Diplomatic Penalty.  Such units as are unable to leave in time may be voluntarily eliminated to avoid the penalty.

	In the Basic Game, the Invisible School of Thaumaturgy, the Tower of Zards, and Stubstaff Keep are non-existent.  Also, large portions of Minaria, such as the Wetlands, the Banished Lands, the Wastes of Vah-Ka-Ka, the Withering, the Blasted Heath, the Shards of Lor, and the Wild Reaches are claimed by no kingdom.  No penalty is incurred for entering such areas.


	Activating a Violated Kingdom    If it happens that the royal castle of a non allied kingdom is occupied by enemy combat units, diplomacy may be conducted by simply placing the ambassador anywhere in that kingdom.  All non eliminated units of a kingdom enter play upon activation, regardless of the presence of enemy units.  If a placement hex is enemy occupied, the dispossessed regulars may be placed in any hex of the kingdom.  (But bear in mind that units that enter upon the map by Random Events as replacements must be deployed in their own placement hex). 

	Combat units may not enter unplundered enemy castle hexes except to siege.  If violating combat units declare a siege on a castle of an unactivated kingdom, the violated kingdom immediately joins the alliance of (activates for) some player monarch other than the invader.  Determined the particular player monarch randomly.  After the combat units of the violated kingdom are set up, the odds of the siege, or sieges, must be re figured to determine if a state of siege still exists (see SIEGES).  If the state of siege no longer exists, the would be besiegers are immediately displaced from the castle hex (see Besieger Displacement).



                          FORCED PEACE

	If an allied royal castle is "plundered" and occupied, the occupying player may attempt to force the dispossessed monarch to make peace (by political coercion).  The occupying player gets a special die roll during his diplomacy phase.  This is called the Forced Peace die roll.  The occupying player's ambassador, meanwhile, may conduct normal diplomacy elsewhere.  If the result of the Forced Peace die roll is a 5 or 6, the kingdom goes into a "Forced Peace."  Diplomacy cards and the Diplomatic Penalty may not be used to modify the Forced Peace die roll.  

	During the diplomacy phase, the player occupying an allied royal castle may choose to use normal diplomacy in an attempt to deactivate the dispossessed monarch.  If this is done, a Forced Peace die roll may not be made and the resultant deactivation is not considered Forced Peace.  The armies and fleets of the kingdom that are the target of a Forced Peace roll may still move and do battle in their own turn, up until the time that the Forced Peace die roll is successful.

	Effects of a Forced Peace    If a kingdom goes into Forced Peace, roll 1 die.  This shows how many full game turns the Forced Peace will last.  During a Forced Peace, no ambassadors may attempt to work diplomacy upon that kingdom.  A kingdom that goes into a Forced Peace must remove all units from the map at the end of the current game turn.  The monarch's Identity and Personality cards are returned to the pool of non allied non player monarchs, and the unit counter for the monarch is placed on the time record track to indicate the turn in which he becomes available again for diplomacy.  

	Once a kingdom has entered Forced Peace, any enemy units that violate the kingdom's territory will incur the Diplomatic Penalty.  Enemy units that are already in the kingdom when the Forced Peace occurs have one movement phase in which to exit the kingdom (or be voluntarily eliminated) without Diplomatic Penalty.  

	Just as a siege may negate a deactivation of a non player kingdom (see DEACTIVATING A NON PLAYER KINGDOM), any besieger may negate a successful Forced Peace die roll in two different ways:

1)  By refusing to displace his besieging units from a castle of the kingdom that would otherwise go into Forced Peace.  The decision to displace one's besieging units or keep them in place must be made immediately upon the successful attainment of a Forced Peace condition by any player.

2)  By the refusal of a third player currently holding the kingdom's monarch captive refuses to release the monarch.

	In either case, treat the Forced Peace as if it had never occurred and no Diplomatic Penalty is incurred.  

	If a player attacks a kingdom where Forced Peace has actually occurred (by initiating a new siege), he causes the Forced Peace to end.  The violator receives the Diplomatic Penalty and regulars of the kingdom are immediately deployed in their hexes and the monarch becomes available to ambassadors.  Only those regulars alive at the time of deactivation will be set up, and plundered castles will remain plundered for the rest of the game.

	Player monarchs who lose their royal castle are never subject to Forced Peace attempts.



                             HEROES

	In the basic game, all units representing individual people are monarch leaders.  Sometimes these units may be referred to as "heroes." 


LEADERS

	All monarchs in Minaria, player and non player, are hero  leaders.  Units stacked with a leader accrue the leader's movement allowance and terrain bonuses, and are able to attack and defend with the aid of any combat bonuses granted by the various leaders' Personality cards.

	Leaders, by themselves, have no combat strength, but may sometimes grant combat bonuses to the combat resolution (via Personality cards).  

	Heroes travelling alone may actually pass through a stack of enemy combat units, or even an enemy castle, but must take a "hero fate die roll" when so doing (see below).


THE LEADER MOVEMENT BONUS

	A monarch leader may give his movement bonus to a stack containing other heroes, his own regulars and/or mercenaries.  Units that begin their turn stacked with a leader may move at the rate that is printed on the counter of that leader.  Units which the player does not wish to have benefit from the leader's bonus should move first.  However, any unit that begins its move in concert with a leader and splits off from the leader's stack before that leader's move is finished must cease movement.  

	If two or more leaders are capable of leading a unit in a stack, only one of them may lead the unit that movement/combat round.  

	EXAMPLE:  A stack of human regulars which is led by their monarch, have a printed movement allowance of 5 points, but may actually expend 7 movement points using leader-assisted movement (i.e. their monarch's movement allowance is 7). 


THE LEADER TERRAIN BONUS

	Some leader units have terrain bonuses on their counters.  All monarchs have mountain, forest, and swamp terrain bonuses when moving in hexes of their own kingdom.  These bonuses are passed on to all units, including other heroes, which the leader leads.

	EXAMPLE 1:  If the monarch of Ghem with one unit and the monarch of Muetar with 2 units are moving through hills, the one Ghem (Dwarven) combat unit and the king of Muetar may accompany the Ghem monarch, through up to 8 hexes of clear terrain and hills.  Because the Muetaran monarch chooses not to move with his own units, the Muetaran combat units can move only 5 movement points, which would take them through just 2 hill hexes.  

	Units with special terrain bonuses that use leader assisted movement lose these bonuses unless the leader also possesses
them.  Thus a unit able to move through forest as clear terrain does not transfer this ability to any leader in its stack.  

	If two leaders with different terrain bonuses are capable of leading a single unit, the unit may be led by, and benefit from the terrain bonuses of, just one of them.  Multiple leaders may not combine movement enhancements in any way.


THE LEADER COMBAT BONUS

	Only those leaders with a Personality card that gives them a combat bonus have a combat bonus in the Basic Game.  If more than 1 leader with such a bonus is involved in a given battle, only one or the other may use his combat bonus.  Combat bonuses do not apply to siege resolution.


THE HERO FATE DIE ROLL

	When a hero is in danger of being killed or captured, he must make a hero fate die roll.  A hero fate die roll is required when:

1.  One or more units in the hero's stack are lost in combat.

2.  The hero (alone) passes through a stack of enemy combat units, or a stack of enemy combat units land on or pass through a lone hero.  This latter action is usually referred to as a "search."  

NOTE:  A lone hero means that there are no 		friendly combat units stacked with the hero.  Several heroes stacked together without friendly combat units as escorts are equally vulnerable.

3.  The hero begins his turn in an enemy stack and attempts to leave it in his movement phase.

4.  A castle containing the hero falls to a siege.

5.  The hero attempts to enter or leave a besieged castle alone.  (To enter/exit the hex and the castle walls is a single die roll, not one for the castle and one the enemy besiegers).

6.  The hero attempts to enter or leave any enemy or neutral castle.  (NOTE:  a hero alone in a non-friendly castle hex is always considered to be inside the castle walls.)

7.  The hero is inside an enemy castle in the turn of the player who controls the castle 

8.  A fleet containing the hero is shipwrecked.

	Whenever one of the above situations occurs, a die must be rolled for each threatened hero.

NOTE:  If a stack begins its turn stacked with an enemy hero and the player wishes to both leave the hex and to make a search, the searching units must expend movement points equal to the terrain cost of the hex which they occupy.  If the hex contains mountain terrain and the searching units lack a mountain terrain bonus, they may search or leave the hex, but not both.



HERO FATE DIE ROLL TABLE
				
				Roll			RESULT
				 1			Hero Killed
				2 5			No Effect
				 6			Hero Captured

	Usually, a hero fate die roll can be forced on a hero only once per a player's movement/combat round.  For example, if a hero's stack is eliminated in combat and the enemy advances on top of the hero, only one hero fate die roll is made.  However, on that hero's next movement/combat round, another hero fate die roll must be made when the hero attempts to leave the hex occupied by enemy combat units.

	Only one hero fate die roll may be required of a given hero during each enemy player's movement.  (For instance, an enemy player may not force 7 die rolls by separately moving 7 combat units over a lone hero). 

	If a hero begins an enemy turn the castle of an enemy player, a hero fate die roll must be made for the hero at the start of the enemy player's random events round.

	A lone hero exiting a besieged castle and passing though a non besieging enemy unit adjacent to it must undergo 2 hero fate die rolls.  In fact, there is no limit to the number of rolls which he must undergo in his own turn for situations that he has created for himself. 

	A lone hero may never be attacked.  Aside from assassination (see DIPLOMACY), the only way heroes may be killed or captured is through the hero fate die roll.  


SHIPWRECKED HEROES

	A hero is either killed, captured, or shipwrecked if he is left without friendly fleets in an all sea hex.  

	A Hero Fate Die Roll is made.  The hero dies on a 1, and is captured on a 6.  On a 2-5 (and on a 6, if no attacking or searching enemy fleets are responsible for his plight), the hero is immediately placed on the Isle of Fright.  The castaway must remain there until picked up by a friendly fleet that moves into the hex.  

	Enemy fleets may not capture a hero on the Isle of Fright, as there are too may caves there in which to hide.  In similar manner, fleets may not unload combat units there because the many reefs surrounding the island make it not worth the danger.  Indeed, fleet movement into the Isle of Fright hex is not allowed unless a rescue is being made.   Ambassadors may still work diplomacy upon a castaway monarch's kingdom, since a temporary regency is assumed.

	Until freed or rescued, shipwreck causes a monarch's combat units to suffer a  1 on all (offensive) combat and siege die rolls in which they make up more than 50% of the participating friendly force.  A non player monarch is automatically removed from his place of exile should his kingdom be deactivated or go into forced peace.

	A hero castaway on an inland body of water is placed on the closest non-port river hex, lake shore, or coastal hex of the same body.  If two hexes are equally close, decide randomly.  A castaway will violate a neutral kingdom if he is cast upon its shore, unless he is eliminated voluntarily.


THE DEATH OF A NON PLAYER MONARCH

	If a non player monarch is killed, his kingdom goes into a form of Forced Peace called Confusion.  Confusion lasts for 1 6 turns (roll 1 die), while a new monarch is being selected.  At the onset of Confusion all of the dead monarch's regulars defend normally, but may not move, siege, or initiate combat for the remainder of the game turn in progress.  At the end of that game turn, the kingdom deactivates.  The unit counter for the monarch is placed on the Turn Record Track some turns ahead (according to the roll of the die).  This represents the turn that the new monarch becomes available for diplomacy.  As in deactivation, any regulars of a kingdom that were eliminated at the time of a monarch's death remain eliminated, even if the kingdom is later reactivated under a new monarch.  Regulars are only replaced via Random Events.

	For example, a monarch is killed during game turn 7, and 4 is rolled on the die.  In this case, place the monarch on the track with four blank spaces between 7 and himself (who sits on turn 12).  That is, the kingdom is in Confusion for the rest of turn 7, and for turns 8, 9, 10, and 11.  The dead monarch's old Personality card is discarded and is shuffled into the deck of unused ones.

	No ambassadors may work diplomacy with a kingdom during the period of Confusion.  At the end of this time, a new monarch is crowned.  Show this by drawing a new Personality card and placing it, face down, under the monarch's Identity card.

	The rules which govern Forced Peace hold for Confusion in regards to sieges and violations.  If an enemy will not abandon a siege of the kingdom, or if a player begins a new siege, a new monarch is immediately crowned (a new Personality card is drawn), and the kingdom becomes the ally of a random player who is enemy to the besieger.


THE CAPTURE OF A NON PLAYER MONARCH

	When a non player monarch is captured, he is immediately placed in the nearest unplundered, unbesieged castle controlled by the capturing player.  If the captor has no such castle, there are two other options, to execute the monarch immediately, or to set the monarch free.  In either case, the captor still gets the victory points for the capture (see VICTORY CONDITIONS).  A captured leader may not be transferred from one prison castle to another, and is incapable of any offensive or defensive action.  The captor does not need to keep a combat unit at the castle    the intrinsic defense factor of the castle constitutes a garrison.

	If a monarch is a captive, that monarch's combat units suffer a -1 modification on the combat die roll, should they make up more than half of the friendly units engaged in a combat situation. 


	There are only 3 ways to free an imprisoned monarch:  

1.  Through the successful siege and plunder of the prison castle by the prisoner's own or allied troops.  

2.  If the kingdom in which the prisoner is being held deactivates in any manner, the prisoner is released and placed in the nearest friendly castle.  

3.  If the castle is plundered by units enemy to the captive, the captive is freed, but remains in place until he is able to move on his own.  Usually this will require one or more hero fate die rolls to evade the new enemy.

	Freeing a Prisoner    A captive freed voluntarily is placed in the nearest castle friendly to him.  If no castle is friendly to the freed captive, he is placed with the nearest friendly combat unit.  If there is no friendly combat unit, the owning player places the freed captive in any hex that he desires.

	Executing a Prisoner    Immediately upon capture, or in any of the captor's subsequent diplomacy phases, a prisoner may be executed.  No additional victory points are awarded for such an execution, though the capturing player still gets the victory points for the capture.  Additionally, the player executing a monarch incurs a Diplomatic Penalty of  1 in the kingdom of the slain monarch.


FORCING PEACE ON A PRISONER

	Forcing peace on a prisoner is similar to forcing peace upon a kingdom due to the capture and occupation of its royal castle (see FORCED PEACE).  Each and every game turn that a monarch is imprisoned, the jailor, during his diplomacy phase, may make a special die roll to attempt to force the captured monarch into peace.  This is also called the Forced Peace die roll.  (See FORCED PEACE).  

	A jailor may choose not to attempt to force peace on his prisoner, but instead may work normal diplomacy on the captive with the ambassador.  In this case Diplomacy cards and penalties do apply, but that is all the ambassador may do on that turn.  NOTE:  Only the jailor's ambassador may work diplomacy on a captured monarch.  Deactivating a captive by normal diplomacy is not considered Forced Peace.





	SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING THE KINGDOMS OF MINARIA

THE TROLLS

	Note that the Trolls set up in 4 separate locations around the map.  They are a common but somewhat disorganized race.  Trolls are regenerative -- in addition to any replacements they may receive via the Random Events Table, they may replace 1 eliminated regular unit (if any) at the beginning of each turn.  The Troll is redeployed at its original placement hex.  If the placement hex is enemy-occupied, the regenerated units may not be brought into play that turn.  Any Troll regulars lost through Random Events may not be regenerated in the same game turn.

	The Trolls have the only kingdom without a royal castle.  Use the scenic hex of Stone Face as a royal castle for diplomacy purposes and mercenary placement.  The Trollish monarch may enter play in any of the 4 scenic hexes of the Troll kingdom.


THE GOBLINS

	Most of the Goblins who inhabit the kingdom of Zorn are labeled "Nithmere Mts."  They are a tribal people dwelling in scattered goat pastures.  Their units must be deployed on the mountain and pass hexes of Zorn; only one may be placed per hex, and no two may be deployed in adjacent hexes.  This rule must be followed both when setting up or when bringing in replacements.


THE DWARVES

	Note that the Dwarves, who own the kingdom of Ghem, set up in 3 widely separated locations determined by the availability of rich mines:  Aws Noir, Alzak, and Rosengg.  Though separated, they are all related and will fight fiercely for a common cause.


HOTHIOR

	Due to the vulnerability of their capital city of Port Lork, the Hothiorans have lately engaged the best engineers to construct a heavy chain on a boom to prevent the entry of unwanted ships.  "Boarhort's Boom" is located in the scenic hex next to Port Lork.  This hex is considered part of Hothior and it is a diplomatic violation for an enemy unit to enter it.  In enemy turns, the Boom is closed, forcing enemy fleets to stop in the Boom hex for 1 turn before entering the hex of Port Lork.  The Boom is open to all fleets if Port Lork is under siege, or enemy-occupied. 


ROMBUNE

	Like Hothior, Rombune has gone to extraordinary lengths in late years to protect its vulnerable quarters by engineering.  The Rombunis have exaggerated the gradual sinking of the hinterland around Parros with man-made canals.  Now Parros is effectively surrounded by a large moat.  A land invasion is still possible, but more costly.  Crossing the canal hexsides of Parros costs an player 2 extra movement points, unless Parros is a friendly castle.  Increase the combat die roll of the stack defending outside the castle by +2, unless the invader attacks with the support of fleets.
